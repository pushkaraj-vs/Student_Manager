Student Manager
=====================

**Student Manager** is aimed to assist the large student community across all disciplines. A life of any aspiring student is no walk-in-the-park and it would be nice if there is someone “in their hands” who can always assist him/her towards achieving their dreams. This application is designed to assist the students in managing all their course-work including lectures and assignments that they learn in schools and colleges or even at home. It helps them by keeping track of their daily chores.
